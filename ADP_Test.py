# This program takes the stand alone game and tests a set of stats, changing one stat (axe low damage range, pot heal amount, ect) every round and 
# send the win/loss percentage rate for every round to an sqlite database. Each test stores value of all stats and if the results are helpful, can be moved to folder called Balancesheets.
# Look at a database set in Balancesheets folder to see results or change stats, turn and round number, 
# This data can be used to balance the stats for the stand alone game
